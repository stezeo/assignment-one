Write a program that reads values from a file and outputs the result to stdout.

Input
Input file's name is "input.txt".

The file contains index-value pairs of integers on a single line. Integers in a pair are separated with a comma (,) and pairs are separated with a semicolon (;).

All indices between 0 and (count_of_pairs - 1) are guaranteed to be present.

The indices are guaranteed to be unique.

The indices are not guaranteed to appear in an ascending order.

Sample input: 1,4;0,2;2,8

Output
The program should output the differences between consecutive values as the index increases.

Output should be printed as a comma separated list of values on a single line to stdout.

For input:

0,1;2,4;1,2
Calculates:

0,1 to 1,2 -> 2 - 1 = 1
1,2 to 2,4 -> 4 - 2 = 2
